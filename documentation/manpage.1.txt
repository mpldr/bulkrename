NAME
----
br - bulkrename files using a texteditor


SYNOPSIS
--------
*br* [-r] [-a] [--editor] [--arg] [--check] [--no-mkdir] [--no-overwrite] FILES...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program allows the renaming of multiple files using any 
text-editor. This is an attempt to create a standalone-version of the	
bulkrename functionality of ranger that was extended to include some 
additional useful features.


OPTIONS
-------
*-v, --version*::
    Print the version of the binary and exit.

*--help*::
    Print a short overview of the usage and exit.

*-r, --recursive*::
    List files recursively. If directories are provided their 
	contents will be listed until a regular file is reached or an 
	empty directory has been found. The default value is false.

*-a, --absolute*::
    List the absolute filepaths in the editor. If a file can be 
	reached by multiple paths (for example through symbolic links) 
	any of these paths can be used. The default value is false.

*--check*::
    Preview the actions that will be executed so errors can be 
	detected. The default value is false.

*--no-mkdir*::
    Do not create directories. By default non-existant directories
	will be created as needed. If this switch is supplied this does
	not happen. Instead an error will occur and all files that should
	be moved into a non-existant directory remains in place. The 
	default value is false.

*--no-overwrite*::
    Do not overwrite files that already exist. By default files that
	already exist will be overwritten. If this switch is supplied
	every file that would overwrite an existing one will not be 
	moved. The default value is false.

*-d, --delete-empty*::
    Delete files whose names have been set to empty strings. By 
	default files with an empty plan will not be moved. If this
	switch is supplied all files that correspond to an empty string
	in the plan will be deleted. The default value is false.

*--editor*=PATH::
    Use the executable provided to edit the plan. Be aware that the
	plan will be read in as soon as this process terminates without
	error. This means that editors like Sublime Text that return
	immediately by default have to be prevented from doing so. In the
	aforementioned editor this can for example be done by providing
	the additional argument --wait. The default is dependant on the
	OS and Environment.

*--arg*=ARGUMENT::
	Supply this argument to the editor-binary. This way additional
	switches may be passed to the editor in order to change its
	behaviour.

*--loglevel*=LEVEL::
	Sets the loglevel to either trace, debug, info, warn, error, or fatal. With
	Increasing verbosity.



ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*BR_RECURSIVE*::
	BR_RECURSIIVE indicates whether the --recursive option is set by default or
	not.

*EDITOR*::
	EDITOR contains the path of the editor binary to use by default.

*BR_ENABLE_TRACE*::
	If set, this enables trace messages. This will create a lot of noise.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    An error occured while the program was running. More information
	can be found earlier in the output.

*2*::
	The provided arguments are erroneous.


BUGS
----
Editor-Arguments starting with a dash can only be provided using the 
--args=--wait syntax. Otherwise the call will fail with exit-code 2.
